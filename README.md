# mcp-server-tripit

`mcp-server-tripit` exposes the TripIt API as an MCP server.

It is built on top of the [`tripit-cli`](https://github.com/dvcrn/tripit-cli) project and uses the published [`tripit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tripit) package to access the full TripIt API.

## Install

Run it directly with:

```bash
npx -y mcp-server-tripit
```

## Usage with Claude

Add it to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tripit": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-server-tripit"],
      "env": {
        "TRIPIT_USERNAME": "your-tripit-username",
        "TRIPIT_PASSWORD": "your-tripit-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to supply the optional client id too:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tripit": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-server-tripit"],
      "env": {
        "TRIPIT_USERNAME": "your-tripit-username",
        "TRIPIT_PASSWORD": "your-tripit-password",
        "TRIPIT_CLIENT_ID": "your-tripit-client-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

The server reads TripIt credentials from environment variables:

Required:

- `TRIPIT_USERNAME`
- `TRIPIT_PASSWORD`

Optional:

- `TRIPIT_CLIENT_ID`

If `TRIPIT_CLIENT_ID` is set, it is passed through to the `tripit` client. If it is omitted, the server does not pass it.

If you use `fnox`, you can also run it like this:

```bash
fnox x -- npx -y mcp-server-tripit
```
